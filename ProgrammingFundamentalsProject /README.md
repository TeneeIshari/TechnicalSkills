Traffic Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes traffic data from three CSV files, providing insights such as the total number of vehicles, peak hour traffic, and visualizing trends using a histogram. The program allows users to enter a specific date, and it processes the relevant traffic data, displaying the results both in Python IDLE and as a graphical representation using a histogram.
